# Microsoft-Excel-Project-Sales-Dashboard
I used Microsoft Excel for a project. This is the project's documentation, and it is a beginner project. I received the project's inspiration from a YouTube teacher.

## **Steps taken to prepare the dataset.**

First, I turn the data into a table and I performed a data validation on each column and changed the data type of the sales column from numbers to currency, so that they were expressed in thousands.

I organized my table to make things easier before I started the analysis as it one of the initial stages before beginning anything at all, I then conducted analysis on the dataset to gather insights and provide answers to some of the following questions:
1.	Top 10 sales 
2.	Bottom 10 sales 
3. The sales trendline
4.	Product comparison 
5. Channel comparison 
6. 	Region comparison 

I also proceeded to design the dashboard template by deciding on the right colors and layouts for the dashboard. I formatted and arranged them.

I then go on to make a pivot table to compile the data into categories and subcategories, combining numerical data, and developing unique calculations and formulas.
## **What are the top ten sales?**
I used the pivot table to calculate the total sales sum and I inserted the order Id beneath the row tab in order to determine the. The data is also filtered to get the top 10.

I selected a stacked bar chart from the insert menu, gave it the proper formatting, and adjusted it to fit my dashboard. 

I completed the others in the same method.

After that, I insert slicers for easy filtering and also identify the current filtering status to make it simpler to comprehend what is actually being displayed.

## **Summary**

Finally, I was able to perform some data analysis using the dataset I downloaded from YouTube. This is only my first piece, but I plan to expand on it over time. Thank you in advance for your comments and recommendations.
